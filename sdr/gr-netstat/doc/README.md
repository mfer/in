Create	a GNU	Radio	model	for	channel	or	network	statistics.
==
In	order to	 have	 an	 efficient	 network,	 one	 needs	 logging.
Also,	 statistics	 are	important	for	network	developers	for	debugging	purposes.
A	nice	project	 would	be	to	build	a	module	for	basic	signal	or	packet	statistics:

    what	was the	 average	 signal-to-noise	 ratio?
    How	 many	 packets	 were	 corrupted?
    How	many	collisions	were	detected?
    How	many	times	the	packet	was	not	transmitted	because	the	medium	was	already	busy?
