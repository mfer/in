Create	a GNU	Radio	model	for	channel	or	network	statistics.
==
In order to have an efficient network, one needs logging.

Also, statistics are important for network developers for debugging purposes.

A nice project would be to build a module for basic signal or packet statistics:

    What was the average signal-to-noise ratio?
    How many packets were corrupted?
    How	many collisions	were detected?
    How	many times the packet was not transmitted because the medium was already busy?




Documentation	 of	 the	 project. Documentation	is	 key	 for	 projects	 that
evolve.	 Future	 students	 working	 on	 SDR	 do	 not	 need	 to	 have	 all	 the	
difficulties	that	you	had,	hence	the	importance	of	documentation.	You	will	
provide	a	text	detailing	step-by-step	how	to	make	the	system	operational.
